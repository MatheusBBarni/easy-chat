# Easy Chat

## Idea
With the question that always comes up, google and facebook have a lot of our data, I had the idea of doing an anonymous chat, where the person enters without a name and the app gives the name to them, and with that he can send messages for others users anonymously.

## How to run the project

First you need to install all deps on client and server with `yarn` or `npm install`.

And then run on server and client:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
